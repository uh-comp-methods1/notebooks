# Alternative setups

If you are fluent with installing software, you might want to consider the following alternatives: 

* [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) instead of full Anaconda

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) instead of JupyterLab


Using Miniconda, you can install the environment specified by [environment.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uh-comp-methods1/notebooks/main/environment.yml) with the command 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
