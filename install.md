# Installation instructions

Install first [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Once you have Anaconda installed, do the following: 

* Download the [environment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uh-comp-methods1/notebooks/main/environment.yml)
* Open Anaconda Navigator
* Click Environments on the left panel
* Click Import
* Choose the file `environment.yml` that you downloaded 
* Set New environment name to **comp-methods** (or whatever you want, but choose the same name below)
* Click Import

The last step takes a while so wait patiently. Once the environment is installed, start JupyterLab in Anaconda Navigator:

* Click Home on the left panel
* Select **comp-methods** in the Applications dropdown menu
* Click the Launch button of JupyterLab 

Now you can download the notebooks in JupyterLab as follows:

* Navigate to a folder where you want to store the notebook using the File Browser on the left panel
* Click the Git button on the left panel
* Click Clone a Repository
* Enter the url of this repository, that is, <https://github.com/uh-comp-methods1/notebooks.git> and click Clone

This creates a new folder called `notebooks`.
